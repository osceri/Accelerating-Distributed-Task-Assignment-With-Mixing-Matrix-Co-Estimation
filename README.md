# Accelerating Distributed Task Assignment With Mixing Matrix Co-Estimation
 
In this repository various distributed algorithms are implemented to solve a task assignment problem wherein robots are to pick up and drop off packages while wasting as little time as possible. This repository and it's accompanying paper in 

    paper/report.pdf

constitute my Stanford EE364B project (Spring 2023). The tests that produced the data used in the final report are found in
